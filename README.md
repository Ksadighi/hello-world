This is research data from the University of Colorado. It contains files and code concerning concentrations of ozone and carbon dioxide measured in Riverside, CA in the summer of 2015. The purpose of the repository is to store the data, and therefore be able to access it publicly in conjunction with the data policy of the journal of Atmospheric Measurement Techniques.
